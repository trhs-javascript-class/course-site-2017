  <h1>Final Project</h1>

  <h2>Creating Tiles</h2>

  <p>
    Please follow each step completely. Use the other lessons and resources
    (Mozilla Developer Network) to help you. You may also get help from your
    classmates. Kevin and Adam will be able to help, so if you get stuck,
    raise your hand to let them know.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 1</h3>

  <p>
    We are going to use a concept called nested for loops to create a 4 by 4
    grid of tiles for our memory game.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, inside our jQuery function (below the stub functions, below the call
    to <code>.empty()</code>, let's add a call to <code>renderTiles()</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2</h3>

  <p>
    Inside of our <code>renderTiles</code> function, declare a
    <code>const</code> variable called <code>gridSize</code>. Set it equal to 4.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, start a for-loop. Name the variable for the for-loop <code>row</code>
    and set it equal to 0. Have the for-loop run as long as the <code>row</code>
    variable is less than the <code>gridSize</code> variable. Increment the
    <code>row</code> variable by 1 using the <code>+=</code> operator. When you
    are finished, it should look like this:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">for (let row = 0; row < gridSize; row += 1) { }</code-block>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>

  <p>
    Inside the braces of this for loop, create a new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
    element using jQuery and store it in a variable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When using a variable to store a jQuery object, it is a good idea to prefix
    the variable with <code>$</code>. This will help you remember that the
    variable's value is a jQuery object. This is just a convention and is not
    required.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When you have finished, your code should look like the code below:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">var $tileRow = $(&quot;&lt;div class=&#39;tile-row&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;);</code-block>
  
  <p>
    <b><i>Important:</i></b> At this point, your tile row has not been added to
    the page. The div inside <code>$tileRow</code> is <i>detached</i> from the
    page. This is like when you write on a post-it note, but you haven't
    stuck the post-it note on the wall. Our tile row exists, it just hasn't been
    added to the HTML page yet.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 4</h3>

  <p>
    Right after the <code>$tileRow</code> variable you just created, create
    another <code>for-loop</code>. (We will refer to this new for-loop as the
    <i>inner for-loop</i>). Name the for-loop variable <code>column</code>, set
    it to equal 0, and have the loop run as long as <code>column</code> is less
    than <code>gridSize</code>. Increment <code>column</code> by 1 each
    iteration.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    See if you can figure out how to write this for loop on your own. If you
    get stuck, ask for help.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The overall outer/inner loop structure should look like this:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">
for (let row = 0; row &lt; gridSize; row += 1) {
  const $tileRow = /* ... */

  for (let column /* that's all you get here :-), ask a classmate or Adam/Kevin if you need help */) {
  }
}
  </code-block>

  <h3>Step 5</h3>

  <p>
    Inside the braces for the inner for-loop, we will again create a new
    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element using the same syntax as in Step 4. Name
    your variable <code>$tile</code>. The HTML code you should use when calling
    jQuery is below:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">&lt;div class=&#39;tile&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code-block>

  <h3>Step 6</h3>

  <p>
    We now should append our <code>$tile</code> div to our <code>$tileRow</code>
    div. We can use the <code>.append()</code> function for this. The contents
    of your inner for-loop should look like the code below:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
var $tile = $("&lt;div class=&#39;tile&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;");
$tileRow.append(tile);
  </code-block>

  <h3>Step 7</h3>

  <p>
    Immediately after the inner for-loop, outside of the braces for it, append
    the contents of <code>$tileRow</code> to the tiles div. Again, you should
    use the <code>.append()</code> function here. You can pass
    <code>$tileRow</code> right into append, no HTML is needed here. Once you
    have done this, refresh your page.
  </p>

  <p>
    The append code should look something like this:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
$(/* remember how to get the "tiles" element by its ID? */)
  .append($tileRow);
  </code-block>

  <p>
    You should now see a 4 by 4 grid of tiles when you save your files and
    refresh the page.
  </p>

  <h3>Sanity Check</h3>

  <p>
    The overall structure of the <code>renderTiles</code> function should look
    something like this:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
  function renderTiles() {
    const gridSize = 4;

    for (let row = 0; /* etc. for outer for loop */) {
      const $tileRow = $(/* create a div tag */);

      for (let column = 0; /* etc. for inner for loop */) {
        const $tile = $(/* create a div tag */);

        $tileRow.append($tile);
      }

      $(/* get "tiles" div by ID */).append($tileRow);
    }
  }
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Once you have finished, please raise your hand so either Kevin or Adam can
    check your work.
  </p>
