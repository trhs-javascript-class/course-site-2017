  <h1>Final Project</h1>

  <h2>Clicking on Tiles</h2>
  
  <p>
    Please follow each step completely. Use the other lessons and resources
    (Mozilla Developer Network) to help you. You may also get help from your
    classmates. Kevin and Adam will be able to help, so if you get stuck,
    raise your hand to let them know.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  
  <p>
    Our goal for this module is to reveal our Pok&eacute;mon as tiles are
    clicked. We will not implement the rules of Memory yet (i.e., we will not
    check for matches or hide non-matching Pok&eacute;mon yet).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first thing we need to do is to create a click handler for all of the
    tiles. This needs to be done once, within the <code>$(function() { })</code>
    code but outside of any of the named functions. Below is a hint on how to
    create the click handler:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">$(/* how to select by tile class? */).on("click", onClickTile);</code-block>
  
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  
  <p>
    Inside the <code>onClickTile</code> function, we will use the jQuery
    <code>.addClass()</code> method to add a few CSS classes to the tile that
    was just clicked.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is also where we will start using the Pok&eacute;mon name that we
    stored using jQuery's <code>.data()</code> method earlier. We will use that
    Pok&eacute;mon name as a CSS class, which will help us show the
    Pok&eacute;mon on the tile.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First let's get the Pok&eacute;mon name for the tile in question:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">const pokemon = $(this).data("pokemon");</code-block>
  
  <p>
    Then we need to add a few CSS classes to the tile:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">
    $(this).addClass(pokemon);
    $(this).addClass("revealed");
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    The Pok&eacute;mon name helps us know which Pok&eacute;mon image to show on
    the tile. The <code>"revealed"</code> class is used to tell the browser to
    show the Pok&eacute;mon.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>

  <p>
    Using the preview mode in Cloud9, preview your page. Make sure you can
    reveal the Pok&eacute;mon by clicking on the tiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Try refreshing your page and clicking on the tiles again. Hopefully the
    Pok&eacute;mon are now showing up in a different order!
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you have finished, please raise your hand so either Kevin or Adam can
    check your work.
