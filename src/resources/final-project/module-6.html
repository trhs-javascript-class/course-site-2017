  <h2>Defining and Counting Moves Taken</h2>
  
  <p>
    Please follow each step completely. Use the other lessons and resources
    (Mozilla Developer Network) to help you. You may also get help from your
    classmates. Kevin and Adam will be able to help, so if you get stuck,
    raise your hand to let them know.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  
  <p>
    Now that we are revealing the Pok&eacute;mon tiles as they are clicked,
    we need to start implementing the Memory game rules.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Memory game rules are as follows:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The player reveals two tiles, one at a time.
    </li>
    <li>
      When two tiles are revealed, we need to check that they are a match.
      <ul>
        <li>
          If so, we leave both tiles face-up, add 1 to the number of matches
          revealed by the player, and allow the player to proceed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, we flip both tiles back over and the player must choose
          two more tiles.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      In either case, we also need to add 1 to the number of moves taken by
      the player.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We will start by adding the logic to increase the Moves Taken counter,
    but only when 2 tiles are revealed.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2</h3>

  <p>
    We need to declare two variables: <code>firstClickedTile</code> and
    <code>secondClickedTile</code>. These values will contain the
    Pok&eacute;mon in the first and second tile the user clicks. Since the
    user will be clicking a lot of tiles, we need to use <code>let</code>
    declarations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Write those declarations inside <code>$(function () { })</code> but
    outside any of the functions. We can set them to <code>null</code> as
    their initial value.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>

  <p>
    Inside the <code>onClickTile</code> function, we will add our tile
    tracking logic to the bottom (after the Pok&eacute;mon-revealing code
    from the previous module).
  </p>

  <p>
    As we noted before, most of the important stuff happens after the user
    has clicked two tiles. So what we will do is set the
    <code>firstClickedTile</code> value on every odd tile click, and the
    <code>secondClickedTile</code> value on every even tile click. When we
    have values for both <code>firstClickedTile</code> and
    <code>secondClickedTile</code>, that's when we will check for a match.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the bottom of the <code>onClickTile</code> function, add an
    <i>if statement</i> to see if we have not yet stored a value in
    <code>firstClickedTile</code>. We can check for this using the
    <b>negation operator</b>, which looks like a <code>!</code> (exclamation
    point).
  </p>

  <p>
    The <i>if statement</i> should look like this:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
if (!firstClickedTile) {
}
  </code-block>

  <p>
    The if-statement could be read as, "if not firstClickedTile", or "if
    firstClickedTile is empty".
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the <i>body</i> (curly braces) of the if statement, we will set
    the <code>firstClickedTile</code> to be the name of the Pok&eacute;mon
    stored in the tile.
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
firstClickedTile = $(this).data("pokemon");
  </code-block>

  <h3>Step 4</h3>

  <p>
    Now we will add an <i>else block</i> to the if statement we just created.
    Inside the <i>else block</i>, we will put the logic for handling when the
    user clicks on a second tile.
  </p>

  <p>
    An if statement with an else block should look something like this:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
if (!firstClickedTile) {
  // Logic for when firstClickedTile has nothing in it
} else {
  // Logic for when firstClickedTile has something in it
}
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Inside the else block, we will set <code>secondClickedTile</code> to the
    Pok&eacute;mon in the tile the user just clicked. The logic should be
    very similar to how we assigned <code>firstClickedTile</code> in the
    previous step.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you are done with these steps, use the Chrome Development Tools
    debugger to step through the <code>onClickTile</code> function and see
    what happens when you click on one tile, and then a second tile.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 5</h3>

  <p>
    Now we will add the code to track when a move has been completed (that
    is, when a player has clicked on two tiles).
  </p>

  <p>
    First, let's create another variable inside <code>$(function () { })</code>
    but outside of the functions. We will call this variable
    <code>movesTaken</code> and set it zero.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the <i>else block</i> of the if statement in the
    <code>onClickTile</code> function, we will update <code>movesTaken</code>
    and then insert its value into the Moves Taken line of the page.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Increment <code>movesTaken</code> by 1.
    </li>
    <li>
      Then, create a jQuery object via ID selector, using the ID we already
      used in the HTML page. Then use the <code>.text()</code> function to
      set that element's text to <code>movesTaken</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <a href="https://api.jquery.com/text/#text2">
      jQuery <code>.text</code> function
    </a>
  </p>

  <h3>Step 6</h3>

  <p>
    We're almost done. Now we need to make it so that a user can do more than
    one move. To do that, we will clear out the <code>firstClickedTile</code>
    and <code>secondClickedTile</code> variables after we have tracked the
    user's move.
  </p>

  <p>
    After incrementing the <code>movesTaken</code> counter and displaying it,
    set the <code>firstClickedTile</code> and <code>secondClickedTile</code>
    variables to <code>null</code>, still within the else block of the if
    statement.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 7</h3>

  <p>
    If everything up to this point has gone well, then every tile click should
    now alternate between two code paths:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      First, we set <code>firstClickedTile</code> to the clicked tile and do
      nothing else.
    </li>
    <li>
      Then, we set <code>secondClickedTile</code>, update and display
      <code>movesTaken</code>, and finally set <code>firstClickedTile</code>
      and <code>secondClickedTile</code> to null.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Use the Chrome Development Tools debugger to confirm that this is what is
    happening.
  </p>

    check your work.
