    Please follow each step completely. Use the other lessons and resources

    classmates. Kevin and Adam will be able to help, so if you get stuck,

  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  
  <p>
    Now that we have gotten the "moves taken" counter working, we need to write
    the code to check for matches.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Just like the code for "moves taken", most of the logic for checking a match
    needs to be run when the user clicks on the second tile in a pair. So we
    will be adding our logic in the same area of the code. However, the
    <code>onTileClick</code> function is starting to get a little long, so we
    want to try to write some of our code in a separate function.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What we're going to do is write logic for actually checking if we have a
    match inside the <code>checkMatch</code> function. Then the
    <code>onTileClick</code> function will call that function to see if the user
    has revealed a match, and proceed from there.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Start by adding an <i>if statement</i> to the <code>onTileClick</code>
    function. This should be done after we have given a value to
    <code>firstTileClicked</code> and <code>secondTileClicked</code>, but before
    updating the <code>movesTaken</code> counter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The if statement should look something like this:
  </p>
  
  <code-block>
if (checkMatch()) {
}
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  
  <p>
    As it turns out, the code for checking a match is pretty simple. All of the
    information we need is in the <code>firstTileClicked</code> and
    <code>secondTileClicked</code> variables.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In fact, all we need to do is check that the values are the same. For
    example, if <code>firstTileClicked</code> is <code>"venusaur"</code>, and
    <code>secondTileClicked</code> is also <code>"venusaur"</code>, then we
    know the user clicked on two Venusaur tiles just now.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will be using the <i>strict equals operator</i> (<code>===</code>) to
    check that the two variables are equal to each other. If they are, we will
    <i>return</i> <code>true</code> from the <code>checkMatch()</code> function,
    so that <code>onClickTile()</code> will know the user chose matching tiles.
    Otherwise, we will return <code>false</code> from <code>checkMatch()</code>,
    and <code>onClickTile()</code> will know that the user did not choose
    matching tiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside <code>checkMatch()</code>, try to create an <i>if/else statement</i>
    that checks that <code>firstTileClicked</code> equals
    <code>secondTileClicked</code>, returns true if they are equal, and returns
    false if they are not equal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use the Chrome Developer Tools debugger to step through your
    <code>checkMatch()</code> function. Make sure it is only called on every
    other tile click, and make sure it returns true if you click on two tiles
    with the same Pok&eacute;mon and false if you click on two tiles with
    different Pok&eacute;mon.
