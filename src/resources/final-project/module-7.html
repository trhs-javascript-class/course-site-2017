  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  
  <p>
    Now that we have gotten the "moves taken" counter working, we need to write
    the code to check for matches.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Just like the code for "moves taken", most of the logic for checking a match
    needs to be run when the user clicks on the second tile in a pair. So we
    will be adding our logic in the same area of the code. However, the
    <code>onTileClick</code> function is starting to get a little long, so we
    want to try to write some of our code in a separate function.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What we're going to do is write logic for actually checking if we have a
    match inside the <code>checkMatch</code> function. Then the
    <code>onTileClick</code> function will call that function to see if the user
    has revealed a match, and proceed from there.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Start by adding an <i>if statement</i> to the <code>onTileClick</code>
    function. This should be done after we have given a value to
    <code>firstTileClicked</code> and <code>secondTileClicked</code>, but before
    updating the <code>movesTaken</code> counter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The if statement should look something like this:
  </p>
  
  <code-block>
if (checkMatch()) {
}
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
