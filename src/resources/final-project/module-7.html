  <h1>Final Project</h1>

  <h2>Checking for Matches</h2>
  
  <p>
    Please follow each step completely. Use the other lessons and resources
    (Mozilla Developer Network) to help you. You may also get help from your
    classmates. Kevin and Adam will be able to help, so if you get stuck,
    raise your hand to let them know.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  
  <p>
    Now that we have gotten the "moves taken" counter working, we need to write
    the code to check for matches.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Just like the code for "moves taken", most of the logic for checking a match
    needs to be run when the user clicks on the second tile in a pair. So we
    will be adding our logic in the same area of the code. However, the
    <code>onTileClick</code> function is starting to get a little long, so we
    want to try to write some of our code in a separate function.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What we're going to do is write logic for actually checking if we have a
    match inside the <code>checkMatch</code> function. Then the
    <code>onTileClick</code> function will call that function to see if the user
    has revealed a match, and proceed from there.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Start by adding an <i>if statement</i> to the <code>onTileClick</code>
    function. This should be done after we have given a value to
    <code>firstClickedTile</code> and <code>secondClickedTile</code>, but before
    updating the <code>movesTaken</code> counter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The if statement should look something like this:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="javascript">
if (checkMatch()) {
}
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  
  <p>
    As it turns out, the code for checking a match is pretty simple. All of the
    information we need is in the <code>firstClickedTile</code> and
    <code>secondClickedTile</code> variables.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In fact, all we need to do is check that the values are the same. For
    example, if <code>firstClickedTile</code> is <code>"venusaur"</code>, and
    <code>secondClickedTile</code> is also <code>"venusaur"</code>, then we
    know the user clicked on two Venusaur tiles just now.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will be using the <i>strict equals operator</i> (<code>===</code>) to
    check that the two variables are equal to each other. If they are, we will
    <i>return</i> <code>true</code> from the <code>checkMatch()</code> function,
    so that <code>onClickTile()</code> will know the user chose matching tiles.
    Otherwise, we will return <code>false</code> from <code>checkMatch()</code>,
    and <code>onClickTile()</code> will know that the user did not choose
    matching tiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside <code>checkMatch()</code>, try to create an <i>if/else statement</i>
    that checks that <code>firstClickedTile</code> equals
    <code>secondClickedTile</code>, returns true if they are equal, and returns
    false if they are not equal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use the Chrome Developer Tools debugger to step through your
    <code>checkMatch()</code> function. Make sure it is only called on every
    other tile click, and make sure it returns true if you click on two tiles
    with the same Pok&eacute;mon and false if you click on two tiles with
    different Pok&eacute;mon.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i><b>Extra challenge:</b></i> Can you think of a way to shorten the code
    in the <code>checkMatch()</code> function? (Hint: What kind of values does
    the <code>===</code> operator actually return?)
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>

  <p>
    Now that we have a working <code>checkMatch()</code> function, we need to
    look at its return value to know if the user clicked matching tiles and then
    update the state of the game accordingly. First, we will update the Matches
    Found counter if the user found a match. This process will be very similar
    to when we updated the Moves Taken counter last lesson.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are the steps to follow this time. See if you can do these steps
    on your own (but do reach out to your classmates or Adam/Kevin if you need
    help):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Create a variable <code>pairsFound</code> with initial value of
      <code>0</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inside the <code>if (checkMatch())</code> statement,
      <ul>
        <li>Increase the <code>pairsFound</code> variable; then</li>
        <li>
          Create a jQuery object using an ID representing the element to
          update, and
        </li>
        <li>
          Update the text of that element to the value of
          <code>pairsFound</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Save your changes and test this out. The "Matches Found" counter should
    update whenever you click on two of the same tile.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 4</h3>

  <p>
    Now we need to turn over the revealed tiles again when we don't have a
    match.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, let's create an <i>else clause</i> in the if-statement we have been
    working in:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
if (checkMatch()) {
    // Stuff we just added earlier :-)
} else {
}
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Inside the else clause, we need to hide the tiles that were revealed by the
    user's clicks. But since this function is already getting complicated, we
    will use the <code>hideClickedTiles</code> function to store this code.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Add a call to <code>hideClickedTiles()</code> in the else clause, where we
    know that the user did not find a match.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 5</h3>
  
  <p>
    Inside the <code>hideClickedTiles()</code> function, we need to find the
    tiles the user had just revealed, so we can then hide the Pok&eacute;mon
    within them. We can do this using a class selector, since we always add
    a certain class to the clicked tiles in the <code>onClickTile</code>
    function.
  </p>

  <p>
    See if you can figure out what class we should use. (We even used the name
    in the previous paragraph, if that helps!)
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
const $clickedTiles = $(".someclass");   // What class should we use?
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Once you have the clicked tiles, we can use jQuery's
    <code>.removeClass()</code> method to remove the classes we added earlier.
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
$clickedTiles.removeClass("revealed");
$clickedTiles.removeClass(/* wait, how do we know which Pok&eacute;mon to remove? */);
  </code-block>

  <p>
    We don't know which Pok&eacute;mon name to remove from the tile's classes...
    Well, why not remove them all?
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
$clickedTiles.removeClass("blastoise charizard dragonite gengar magikarp mew pikachu venusaur");
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Don't worry, jQuery is smart enough to only remove classes that are actually
    on the element.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 6</h3>

  <p>
    As you have probably noticed, when you click on a second tile, you can't
    see what it is! This is because we are flipping the tiles back over right
    away after we know the user didn't find a pair. Unfortunately, computers
    are a lot faster than our eyes!
  </p>

  <p>
    We will be using a <b>timeout</b> to get around this problem. In JavaScript,
    a timeout is set up using a function called <b>setTimeout</b>. After a
    certain amount of time has passed, JavaScript will execute code, without
    user input. In our case, we will use <b>setTimeout</b> to add a delay to
    our code before we hide the clicked tiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're already halfway there since we used a separate function,
    <code>hideClickedTiles</code>. All we need to do is replace our normal
    function call, <code>hideClickedTiles()</code>, with a timeout:
  </p>

  <code-block language="javascript">
setTimeout(hideClickedTiles, 1000);
  </code-block>

  <p>
    The second <i>argument</i> to the function is the timeout delay, in
    milliseconds. In other words, it's how long we want to wait before
    <code>hideClickedTiles</code> is executed. In our case, 1000 means one
    thousand milliseconds, or one second.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i><b>Important:</b></i> Do not add parentheses to
    <code>hideClickedTiles</code> in this <code>setTimeout</code> call! This
    is because if we use parentheses, we'll call <code>hideClickedTiles</code>
    normally (that is, instantly, rather than after a timeout). Instead, we
    are simply giving <code>setTimeout</code> the name of the function we want
    it to call later, and then <code>setTimeout</code> will call the function
    in its own code.
  </p>

  <p>
    Try playing around with the timeout delay. What happens if you use a lower
    number, like 500? What if you use a higher number, like 2000?
  </p>

  <h3>Step 7</h3>

  <p>
    Now we need to fix the fact that previously revealed tiles are also flipped
    back over if the user clicks non-matching tiles afterwards.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this case, our problem is that one CSS class ("revealed") is really being
    used for two purposes: Showing previously matched tiles, and showing clicked
    tiles. So we can make this work by using another CSS class. We'll use a
    "clicked" CSS class to show tiles that have just been clicked. That way,
    "revealed" will just be a class meaning we want the tile to be visible.
  </p>

  <p>
    We need to make three changes to make this work:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      First, change the beginning of the <code>onClickTile</code> function to
      add a "clicked" class, as well as "revealed" and the Pok&eacute;mon name.
    </li>
    <li>
      Then, go to the area of code where we are hiding the tiles after a
      non-matching move. Instead of hiding all of the revealed tiles, hide the
      clicked tiles. Make sure to also remove the "clicked" class from those
      tiles.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, we need to update the "match found" logic. In this case, we want
      to leave those tiles revealed, but removed the "clicked" class from them
      so they aren't hidden later.
    </li>
  </p>

  <h3>Step 8</h3>

  <p>
    At this point, you should be able to reveal matches, and when you don't get
    a match, the tiles flip back over. Previously revealed matches should stay
    visible without being flipped over.

    check your work.
