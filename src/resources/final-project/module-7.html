  <h1>Final Project</h1>

  <h2>Checking for Matches</h2>
  
  <p>
    Please follow each step completely. Use the other lessons and resources
    (Mozilla Developer Network) to help you. You may also get help from your
    classmates. Kevin and Adam will be able to help, so if you get stuck,
    raise your hand to let them know.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  
  <p>
    Now that we have gotten the "moves taken" counter working, we need to write
    the code to check for matches.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Just like the code for "moves taken", most of the logic for checking a match
    needs to be run when the user clicks on the second tile in a pair. So we
    will be adding our logic in the same area of the code. However, the
    <code>onTileClick</code> function is starting to get a little long, so we
    want to try to write some of our code in a separate function.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What we're going to do is write logic for actually checking if we have a
    match inside the <code>checkMatch</code> function. Then the
    <code>onTileClick</code> function will call that function to see if the user
    has revealed a match, and proceed from there.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Start by adding an <i>if statement</i> to the <code>onTileClick</code>
    function. This should be done after we have given a value to
    <code>firstTileClicked</code> and <code>secondTileClicked</code>, but before
    updating the <code>movesTaken</code> counter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The if statement should look something like this:
  </p>
  
  <code-block>
if (checkMatch()) {
}
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  
  <p>
    As it turns out, the code for checking a match is pretty simple. All of the
    information we need is in the <code>firstTileClicked</code> and
    <code>secondTileClicked</code> variables.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In fact, all we need to do is check that the values are the same. For
    example, if <code>firstTileClicked</code> is <code>"venusaur"</code>, and
    <code>secondTileClicked</code> is also <code>"venusaur"</code>, then we
    know the user clicked on two Venusaur tiles just now.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will be using the <i>strict equals operator</i> (<code>===</code>) to
    check that the two variables are equal to each other. If they are, we will
    <i>return</i> <code>true</code> from the <code>checkMatch()</code> function,
    so that <code>onClickTile()</code> will know the user chose matching tiles.
    Otherwise, we will return <code>false</code> from <code>checkMatch()</code>,
    and <code>onClickTile()</code> will know that the user did not choose
    matching tiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside <code>checkMatch()</code>, try to create an <i>if/else statement</i>
    that checks that <code>firstTileClicked</code> equals
    <code>secondTileClicked</code>, returns true if they are equal, and returns
    false if they are not equal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use the Chrome Developer Tools debugger to step through your
    <code>checkMatch()</code> function. Make sure it is only called on every
    other tile click, and make sure it returns true if you click on two tiles
    with the same Pok&eacute;mon and false if you click on two tiles with
    different Pok&eacute;mon.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i><b>Extra challenge:</b></i> Can you think of a way to shorten the code
    in the <code>checkMatch()</code> function? (Hint: What kind of values does
    the <code>===</code> operator actually return?)
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>

  <p>
    Now that we have a working <code>checkMatch()</code> function, we need to
    look at its return value to know if the user clicked matching tiles and then
    update the state of the game accordingly. First, we will update the Matches
    Found counter if the user found a match. This process will be very similar
    to when we updated the Moves Taken counter last lesson.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are the steps to follow this time. See if you can do these steps
    on your own (but do reach out to your classmates or Adam/Kevin if you need
    help):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Create a variable <code>matchesFound</code> with initial value of
      <code>0</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inside the <code>if (checkMatch())</code> statement,
      <ul>
        <li>Increase the <code>matchesFound</code> variable; then</li>
        <li>
          Create a jQuery object using an ID representing the element to
          update, and
        </li>
        <li>
          Update the text of that element to the value of
          <code>matchesFound</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Save your changes and test this out. The "Matches Found" counter should
    update whenever you click on two of the same tile.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 4</h3>

  <p>
    Now we need to turn over the revealed tiles again when we don't have a
    match.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, let's create an <i>else clause</i> in the if-statement we have been
    working in:
  </p>

  <code-block>
if (checkMatch()) {
    // Stuff we just added earlier :-)
} else {
}
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Inside the else clause, we need to hide the tiles that were revealed by the
    user's clicks. We can do this using a class selector, since we always add
    a certain class earlier in the <code>onClickTile</code> function.
  </p>

  <p>
    See if you can figure out what class we should use. (We even used the name
    in the previous paragraph, if that helps!)
  </p>

  <code-block>
const $clickedTiles = $(".someclass");   // What class should we use?
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Once you have the clicked tiles, we can use jQuery's
    <code>.removeClass()</code> method to remove the classes we added earlier.
  </p>

  <code-block>
$clickedTiles.removeClass("revealed");
$clickedTiles.removeClass(/* wait, how do we know which Pok&eacute;mon to remove?
  </code-block>

  <p>
    We don't know which Pok&eacute;mon name to remove from the tile's classes...
    Well, why not remove them all?
  </p>

  <code-block>
$clickedTiles.removeClass("blastoise charizard dragonite gengar magikarp mew pikachu venusaur");
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Don't worry, jQuery is smart enough to only remove classes that are actually
    on the element.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this point, you should be able to reveal matches, and when you don't get
    a match, the tiles flip back over. There's just one major problem... which
    we will address next module! (Not very nice of us to have a cliffhanger
    ending to this module, but that's how it goes!)
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you have finished, please raise your hand so either Kevin or Adam can
    check your work. (And show us the bugs you have found!)
