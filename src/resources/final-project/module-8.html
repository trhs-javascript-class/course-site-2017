  <h1>Final Project</h1>

  <h2>Fixing Bugs and Final Touches</h2>
  
  <p>
    At this point, you should have a functional Memory game. We will use the
    rest of the time to fix any issues or add minor enhancements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please work with other students to come up with things to add, and then
    Kevin or Adam will walk through adding them with the class.

  <h3>Example Bug?</h3>

  <p>
    To get you started on bug hunting, let's ask one question: Have you tried
    revealing a pair of Pok&eacute;mon, and then clicking on one of the
    revealed tiles before clicking a face-down tile?
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>How should it behave? (Should this be a complete move, or not?)</li>
    <li>How does it actually behave?</li>
  </ul>
