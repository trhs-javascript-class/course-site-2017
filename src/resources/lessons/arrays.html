  <h1>Arrays</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Arrays are arguably the most important structure in programming and Computer Science. At their root, they form the
    basis of what we call <b>Data Structures</b> and allow the programmer to compose sets of data to use as inputs or
    outputs. This lesson will look closer at this important and valuable tool.</p>

  <h2>Declaring an Array</h2>

  <p>In JavaScript, declaring an <b>array</b> is very similar to declaring a variable like we did in the last lesson.
    However there is an important difference in
    <b>syntax</b> that you must note, and that is the use of the square-bracket operators <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. The
    code example below shows how to declare an
    <b>empty array</b>.</p>

  <code-block>// An empty array
const myEmptyArray = [];</code-block>

  <p>Declaring an empty array such as the example above isn't terribly useful to us right now. We need to get
    <b>values</b> into this array. We can put data into an array one of two ways. The most common way is to <b>push</b>
    the data into the array based on some other inputs, but we will go over this later in the lesson. We can also put
    data into the array at declaration, by following the syntax below.</p>

  <code-block>// An array with some values
const myFavoritesCars = ['porsche', 'corvette', 'alfa romeo'];</code-block>

  <p>Using the <i>console.log()</i> function, we can print out the contents of an array similar to how we did with
    variables.</p>

  <code-block>// An array we'll print out
const myFavoriteColors = ['blue', 'red', 'orange', 'black'];

console.log(myFavoriteColors); // Output: ["blue", "red", "orange", "black"]</code-block>

  <p>While <i>console.log()</i> is useful for outputting the full contents of an array, in actual programs we will
    rarely do this. Normally we access array values directly by their <b>index</b> or an <b>iterator</b>.</p>

  <h2>Indexes and Iterators</h2>

  <p>We can get the <b>length</b> of an array by using a special property on our array we can access by adding <i>.length</i>
    to the end of our array. This allows us to know exactly how many values we have in our array. This will become more
    important in our next lesson, but knowing it now will help you to understand <b>indexes</b> better. The example
    below shows the output of the length property for our favorite colors array.</p>

  <code-block>// An array we'll print out
const myFavoriteColors = ['blue', 'red', 'orange', 'black'];

console.log(myFavoriteColors.length); // Output: 4</code-block>

  <p>Each value of an array has a numeric value that corresponds to the <b>index</b> of the value. Arrays in JavaScript
    are
    <b>zero-based</b> so these index values start at 0 and end at <i>array.length - 1</i> of the array. For our favorite
    colors array
    the <b>index</b> of 2 corresponds to "orange", and the <b>index</b> of 0 corresponds to "blue". We can access a
    specific <b>element</b>
    or value of an array by using square-bracket operators at the end of the call to the array. The example below
    demonstrates this.</p>

  <code-block>// Let's print out these values each on a new line.
const myFavoriteColors = ['blue', 'red', 'orange', 'black'];

console.log(myFavoriteColors[0]); // Output: blue
console.log(myFavoriteColors[1]); // Output: red
console.log(myFavoriteColors[2]); // Output: red
console.log(myFavoriteColors[3]); // Output: black

console.log(myFavoriteColors[4]); // Output: undefined</code-block>

  <p>Oops, we had an extra value there. JavaScript, unlike many languages, doesn't consider accessing an <b>array
    element</b> that doesn't exist an error. Instead, it returns the value of undefined. This is a common source of
    errors, so make sure you remember to start counting from <b>zero</b>. You can also use a conditional to check if a
    value exists before you print it out.</p>

  <code-block>// We'll print out something that doesn't exist.
const myFavoriteColors = ['blue', 'red', 'orange', 'black'];

const myColor = myFavoriteColors[4];

if (myColor) {
  console.log(myColor);
} else {
  console.log('myColor doesn't exist!');
}

// Output: myColor doesn't exist!</code-block>

  <h2>Manipulating an Array</h2>

  <p>JavaScript provides us with several methods to <b>manipulate</b> arrays. While there are close to 30 different
    actions we can take on an array, but for today we'll look at a few of the most important methods.</p>

  <p>Arguably the most important is the ability to add or remove to the end of an array. We call these actions
    <b>push</b> and <b>pop</b>. When we <b>push</b> to an array, we add an <b>element</b> to the end of the array that
    contains our value. We can also <b>pop</b> off the <b>last element</b> of an array. The example below demonstrates
    how this works.</p>

  <code-block>// We'll make an array to track things we need to do.
const thingsToDo = ['sleep', 'call parents'];

console.log(thingsToDo); // Output: ["sleep", "call parents"]

// When we need to add something, we can use push.
thingsToDo.push('make memes');

console.log(thingsToDo); // Output: ["sleep", "call parents", "make memes"]

// When we complete the last action on our list, we can pop it off into a variable.
const justDid = thingsToDo.pop();

console.log(`I just did ${justDid}`); // Output: I just did make memes
console.log(thingsToDo); // Output: ["sleep", "call parents"]</code-block>

  <p>With our example, what if we wanted to complete the "call parents" action? In order to remove that from our list
    we'd need to do "make memes" first with the tools we currently have. However, there is another method called <b>splice</b>
    that allows us to add or remove specific elements.</p>

  <code-block>// This time we'll finish the call parents action. We have all 3 tasks already in the array.
const thingsToDo = ['sleep', 'call parents', 'make memes'];

console.log(thingsToDo); // Output: ["sleep", "call parents", "make memes"];

// We've just called our parents, lets remove that value. Remember arrays are zero-based!
thingsToDo.splice(1, 1); // This means starting at element 1 (the second element), we want to remove 1 element.

console.log(thingsToDo); // Output: ["sleep", "make memes"];

// We can also add two tasks to the middle of our array using splice. Lets add "brush dog" and "walk cat".
thingsToDo.splice(1, 0, 'brush dog', 'walk cat');

console.log(thingsToDo); // Output: ["sleep", "brush dog", "walk cat", "make memes"]</code-block>

  <p>Often, when we write the program we don't know where a specific value will be in an array. We can find the
    <b>index</b> of the element we want to remove using the <b>indexOf</b> method.</p>

  <code-block>// Lets find the index of the 'call parents' task. Store it in a variable, and then remove it using splice.
const thingsToDo = ['sleep', 'call parents', 'make memes'];

console.log(thingsToDo); // Output: ["sleep", "call parents", "make memes"];

const taskIndex = thingsToDo.indexOf('call parents');
const justRemoved = thingsToDo.splice(taskIndex, 1); // We can store the removed value in an array, like with pop.

console.log(`I just removed ${justRemoved}`); // Output: I just removed call parents
console.log(thingsToDo);
  </code-block>

  <p>There are many other actions that we can take against our arrays, some of which we will go over in the next lesson.
    However, the ones we've reviewed here are the most common actions you'll take. Try the exercises to sharpen your
    skills with arrays.</p>

  <h1>Exercises</h1>

  <p>Put all of these exercises in a single file.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Declare an array called "myFavoriteFoods" with 3 or more of your favorite foods, then print the result out to
      the console.
    </li>
    <li>Use the pop function to remove one of your favorite foods, storing the value in a variable called "foodItem".
      Print out the array.
    </li>
    <li>Now, using the push function and your "foodItem" variable, add it back to your array. Print out the array.</li>
    <li>Print out the 3rd item in your array to the console.</li>
    <li>Using splice, remove the second item in your array, and print the array to the console.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>When you are done with the exercises have Kevin or Adam check your work.</p>
