  <h1>(Poor Man's) Binary Clock Project</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>With this project we will be building a simple version of a binary clock.
  A binary clock is a special kind of clock which portrays the time in binary.
  These clocks are often written in a variety of ways and a quick Google search
  will show you just how varied the designs for these clocks can be.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of our project, we will be making the simplest binary
  clock possible. We will be doing this project together so make sure to follow
  along as we go  through the steps. The code blocks below are provided for you
  to copy and paste when told.</p>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <h3>Step 1</h3>

  <p>We will create a new Cloud9 project.</p>

  <h3>Step 2</h3>

  <p>We need to start by laying out our <code>index.html</code> file. Copy the
  below block into your editor and follow along as we add some additional
  pieces.</p>

  <code-block language="html">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;(Poor Man's) Binary Clock&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;binary-clock.css&quot;&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;//code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;src/binary-clock.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code-block>

  <h3>Step 3</h3>

  <p>Next we will create our JavaScript file, called
  <code>binary-clock.js</code> and fill in the necessary functions to make it
  show us a basic, normal clock. We will make this clock start and stop with the
  click of a button. Use the code block below as a template.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">/* global $ */

(function() {
    function drawNormalClock(hours, minutes, seconds) {
    }

    function drawBinaryClock(hours,minutes, seconds) {
      // We won't fill this in yet.
    }

    function start() {
    }

    function stop() {
    }

    function update() {
    }

    drawNormalClock(0, 0, 0);
})();</code-block>

  <p>Finally, we will finish off the project by creating our simple binary
  clock. There are no code blocks for us to copy here. Just follow along and we
  will write all the code by hand.</p>
