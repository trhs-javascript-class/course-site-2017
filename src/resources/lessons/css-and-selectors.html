  <h1>CSS and Selectors</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    <b>CSS</b> stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>. We use CSS in order to
    change the <i>presentation</i> of our content.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In this way, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript focus on different aspects of a web
    site:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      HTML contains the <i>content</i> of a web page.
    </li>
    <li>
      CSS describes the <i>presentation and style</i> of a web page.
    </li>
    <li>
      JavaScript focuses on the <i>behavior and interaction</i> of a web page.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Using CSS to Style Your Content</h2>
  
  <p>
    Before we talk about how to actually style our pages through CSS, we need to
    talk about where we can define our style information.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are three locations for styles:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Inline styles</li>
    <li>Embedded styles</li>
    <li>External styles</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Inline Styles</h3>
  
  <p>
    <b>Inline styles</b> are styles that are applied to individual HTML
    elements. We can use the <code>style</code> attribute on any element to
    style just that element.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here's an example of an inline style:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p style="color: red"&gt;The text in this paragraph is red.&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>

  <p>
    Inline styles work really well for making individual elements stand out.
    However, if we want all of our paragraphs to have red text, this will
    get inconvenient very quickly.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Embedded Styles</h3>
  
  <p>
    <b>Embedded styles</b> are great for applying the same style to multiple,
    similar HTML elements. For example, let's say we want to make all paragraphs
    have red text. Embedded styles allow you to do just that.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Embedded styles are put onto the page using a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
    tag. (Note: This is distinct from the <code>style</code> <i>attribute</i>
    that we use for inline styles on HTML elements.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When writing embedded styles using a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, we use
    a <code>type</code> attribute to tell the browser we are using CSS as our
    styling language. Then we can write our styles using <b>CSS rules</b>.
    We will go through how to write CSS rules in a little bit.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of a CSS rule in an embedded style sheet:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
      p {
        color: red;
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow! This paragraph will have red text, without having to write a color
      inside the HTML.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And so will this paragraph!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And this one!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>

  <h3>External Styles</h3>
  
  <p>
    Embedded style sheets provide a consistent set of styles across a page.
    When you want to use the same styles on multiple pages across an entire
    website, though, <b>external styles</b> are the way to go.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    External styles are very similar to embedded styles. The only difference is
    where the style rules are located. For external styles, we write our style
    rules in a <code>.css</code> file and then pull the file into our HTML pages
    using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Be careful: We use the &lt;a&gt; or <i>anchor</i> tag for creating
    hyperlinks. The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag is for pulling two resources
    together: in this case, an HTML document and an external CSS file.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is how the above example would look using external styles:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
/* This is the CSS file. (This line is a comment, which doesn't do anything.) */

p {
  color: red;
}
  </code-block>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="myStyles.css" type="text/css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow! This paragraph will have red text, without having to write a color
      inside the HTML.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And so will this paragraph!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And this one!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Most of the time, external styles are the best way to do things. CSS files
    can be pulled in easily from HTML pages, and they help ensure consistent
    styles across your website.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Anatomy of a CSS Rule</h2>
  
  <p>
    As we mentioned earlier, styles are expressed in terms of <b>CSS rules</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A CSS rule has two parts.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The <b>selector</b>, which describes the elements to which the styles
      will be applied. (In the rule <code>p { color: red }</code>, the
      <code>p</code> is the selector.)
    </li>
    <li>
      One or more <b>properties</b>, which are the stylistic changes that will
      be applied to elements that match the rule's selector. (In the rule
      <code>p { color: red }</code>, <code>color: red</code> is a property.)
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The properties for a rule are surrounded by curly braces. Each property is
    composed of a name and a value, separated by a colon. Each property is
    terminated by a semicolon.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Selectors</h3>
  
  <p>
    There are many different types of selectors. In this class, we will show
    only three types of selectors to keep things simple. These three types of
    selectors will cover 85% or more of all situations you will encounter as a
    web developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are the three types of selectors we will focus on:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Tag selectors</li>
    <li>Class selectors</li>
    <li>ID selectors</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Tag selectors</h4>
  
  <p>
    <b>Tag selectors</b> are selectors that match elements by their tag name.
    We saw a tag selector in a recent example: <code>p</code>. This selector
    matches all elements that have <i>p</i> as their tag name: in other words,
    paragraph tags.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rules with tag selectors are useful when you want to apply styles to many
    elements with the same HTML tag.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition, you can apply styles to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag in
    order to apply styles to the entire page. For example:
  </p>

  <code-block language="css">
body {
  color: blue;  /* All text on the page will be blue */
}
  </code-block>
  
  <h4>Class selectors</h4>
  
  <p>
    <b>Class selectors</b> are selectors that match elements by class name.
    But wait, what is a class name?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A <b>class name</b> is just a way we can classify HTML elements.
    We can apply a class name through the <code>class</code> attribute on any
    HTML element. Class names can be applied to HTML elements with different
    tag names, and we can then apply styles to all of those elements using a
    class selector.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We can use almost any string as a class name (as long as it doesn't have a
    space in it). We can use hyphens to create a class name with multiple words.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some example classes:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><code>red</code></li>
    <li><code>note</code></li>
    <li><code>important-info</code></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Classes are specified using the <code>class</code> attribute on any element:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p class="my-class"&gt;This paragraph has class.&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Class names don't do anything by themselves. If all you do is put a class
    attribute on every element in your HTML, nothing will look any different.
    The real power of classes comes from using classes in CSS rules.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of a CSS rule that uses a class selector:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
.red {
  color: red;
}
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    A class selector starts with a <code>.</code> (period), followed by the
    name of the class you want to trigger this style rule. Any style properties
    declared in the rule will be applied to all elements with a matching class
    name.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By the way, HTML elements can have more than once class name. Multiple
    class names are separated with spaces:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p class="red bold"&gt;A paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    When an element has multiple class names, it will be affected by rules
    that mention only one or some of its classes. For example, a rule with a
    <code>.red</code> selector will be applied to the paragraph above, and so
    will a rule with a <code>.bold</code> selector. Therefore, you should use
    multiple classes with simple style meanings ("red" and "bold" individually)
    rather than one class with a more complex style meaning ("redbold" which
    means both). That way, you can just use both classes, like we did above.
  </p>
  
  <h4>ID selectors</h4>
  
  <p>
    <b>ID selectors</b> are similar to class selectors. Elements can be given an
    ID using the <code>id</code> attribute.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are two differences between an ID and a class name:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      An element can only have one ID.
    </li>
    <li>
      No two HTML elements can have the same ID on the same page.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of an element with an ID:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p id="some-id"&gt;My paragraph with an identity&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    And here is an example of a style rule using an ID selector:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
#some-id {
  color: red;
}
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    An ID selector starts with a <code>#</code> (<s>hashtag</s> hash symbol),
    followed by the name of the ID that you want to trigger this style rule.
    Any style properties declared in the rule will be applied to the one
    element with the ID used in the rule.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Properties</h3>
  
  <p>
    In a CSS rule, <b>properties</b> are how we describe the actual styles we
    want to apply to a set of elements matched by a selector.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are a lot of properties, and sadly, we don't have time to teach
    even one tenth of them. But we will give you three highly useful properties.
    If you want to learn more, you can go to our Resources page and bookmark
    the links in the <i>CSS</i> section.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Text Color</h4>
  
  <p>
    You can set the text color for elements matched by a selector using the
    <code>color</code> property, such as <code>color: red;</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are a few ways to represent colors in CSS. Many colors can be named
    (such as red), see the Resources page for more details.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can also use a <b>rgb representation</b> if you want to fine-tune your
    colors, by representing the color using its red, green, and blue components.
    Each component can be a value between 0 and 255. Here is an example for
    dark gray:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
p {
  color: rgb(64, 64, 64);
}
  </code-block>
  
  <h4>Background Color</h4>
  
  <p>
    You can set the background color for elements matched by a selector using
    the <code>background-color</code> property, such as
    <code>background-color: black;</code>. Background colors are represented
    the same way as text colors.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Text alignment</h4>
  
  <p>
    You can set the horizontal alignment of text in elements matched by a
    selector using the <code>text-align</code> property, such as
    <code>text-align: right;</code>. For this property, you can use
    <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>, or <code>right</code> as values.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
.right {
  text-align: right;
}
  </code-block>
