  <h1>CSS and Selectors</h1>

  <h2>Using CSS to Style Your Content</h2>
  
  <p>
    Before we talk about how to actually style our pages through CSS, we need to
    talk about where we can use styles.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are three types of styles:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Inline styles</li>
    <li>Embedded styles</li>
    <li>External styles</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Inline Styles</h3>
  
  <p>
    <b>Inline styles</b> are styles that are applied directly to HTML elements.
    We can use the <code>style</code> attribute on any element to style just
    that element.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here's an example of an inline style:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p style="color: red"&gt;The text in this paragraph is red.&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Embedded Styles</h3>
  
  <p>
    If you want all of your paragraphs to have red text, you can see that it
    will get really frustrating really quickly to use inline styles on all
    paragraphs. Wouldn't it be great if we could just say that all paragraphs
    should be red? <b>Embedded styles</b> allow you to do just that.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Embedded styles are put onto the page using a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
    tag. We use a <code>type</code> attribute in the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
    tag to tell the browser we are using CSS. Then we can write our styles in
    the form of <i>CSS rules</i>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of a CSS rule in an embedded style sheet:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
      p {
        color: red;
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow! This paragraph will have red text, without having to write a color
      inside the HTML.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And so will this paragraph!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And this one!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>External Styles</h3>
  
  <p>
    Embedded style sheets do a great job of providing a consistent set of styles
    across a page. When you want to use the same styles across an entire
    website, though, <b>external styles</b> are the way to go.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    External styles are very similar to embedded styles. The only difference is
    where the style rules are located. For external styles, we write our style
    rules in a <code>.css</code> file and then pull the file into our pages
    using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag. (Be careful: We use the &lt;a&gt;
    or <i>anchor</i> tag for creating hyperlinks. The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
    tag is for pulling two resources together&mdash;in this case, an HTML
    document and an external CSS file.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is how the above example would look using external styles:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
/* This is the CSS file. (This line is a comment, which doesn't do anything.) */

p {
  color: red;
}
  </code-block>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="myStyles.css" type="text/css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow! This paragraph will have red text, without having to write a color
      inside the HTML.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And so will this paragraph!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And this one!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Most of the time, external styles are the best way to do things. CSS files
    can be pulled in easily from HTML pages, and they help ensure consistent
    styles across your website.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Anatomy of a CSS Rule</h2>
  
  <p>
    As we mentioned earlier, styles are expressed in terms of <b>CSS rules</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A CSS rule has two parts. First is the <b>selector</b>, which describes the
    elements to which the styles will be applied. After the selector comes the
    <b>properties</b>, which are actual styles that will be applied to elements
    that match the rule's selector. Properties are surrounded by curly braces.
    Each property is composed of a name and a value, separated by a colon.
    Each property is terminated by a semicolon.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Selectors</h3>
  
  <p>
    There are many different types of selectors. In this class, we will show
    only three types of selectors to keep things simple. We guarantee that these
    three types of selectors will cover 85% or more of all situations you will
    encounter as a web developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are the three types of selectors we will focus on:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Tag selectors</li>
    <li>Class selectors</li>
    <li>ID selectors</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Tag selectors</h4>
  
  <p>
    <b>Tag selectors</b> are selectors that match elements by their tag name.
    We saw a tag selector in a recent example: <code>p</code>. This selector
    matches all elements that have <i>p</i> as their tag name: in other words,
    paragraph tags.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rules with tag selectors are useful when you want to apply styles to many
    elements with the same HTML tag. In addition, you can apply styles to the
    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag in order to apply styles to the entire page.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Class selectors</h4>
  
  <p>
    <b>Class selectors</b> are selectors that match elements by their class
    name. But wait, what is a class name?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A <b>class name</b> is an attribute we can assign to any HTML element. We
    can use class names in order to classify HTML elements (possibly with
    different tag names) as needing the same styles applied.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We can use almost any string as a class name (as long as it doesn't have a
    space in it). We can use hyphens to create a class name with multiple words.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some example classes:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><code>red</code></li>
    <li><code>important-info</code></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Classes are specified using the <code>class</code> attribute on any element:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p class="my-class"&gt;This paragraph has class.&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Class names don't do anything by themselves. If all you do is put a class
    attribute on every element in your HTML, nothing will look any different.
    The real power of classes comes from using classes in CSS rules.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of a rule that uses a class selector:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
.red {
  color: red;
}
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    A class selector starts with a <code>.</code> (period), and that is followed
    by the name of the class you want to trigger this style rule. Any style
    properties declared in the rule will be applied to all elements with a
    matching class name.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By the way, HTML elements can have more than once class name. Multiple
    class names are separated with spaces:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p class="red bold"&gt;A paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    When an element has multiple class names, it will be affected by rules
    that mention only one or some of its classes. For example, a rule with a
    <code>.red</code> selector will be applied to the paragraph above, and so
    will a rule with a <code>.bold</code> selector. Therefore, you should use
    multiple classes with simple style meanings ("red" and "bold" individually)
    rather than one class with a more complex style meaning ("redbold" which
    means both). That way, you can just use both classes, like we did above.
  </p>
  
  <h4>ID selectors</h4>
  
  <p>
    <b>ID selectors</b> are similar to class selectors. Elements can be given an
    ID using the <code>id</code> attribute. The major difference between an ID
    and a class name is that an element can only have one ID&mdash;and also, no
    two HTML elements can have the same ID on the same page.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of an element with an ID:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p id="some-id"&gt;My paragraph with an identity&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    And here is an example of a style rule using an ID selector:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
#some-id {
  color: red;
}
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    An ID selector starts with a <code>#</code> (<s>hashtag</s> hash symbol),
    and that is followed by the name of the class you want to trigger this style
    rule. Any style properties declared in the rule will be applied to the one
    element with the ID used in the rule.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Properties</h3>
  
  <p>
    In a CSS rule, <b>properties</b> are how we describe the actual styles we
    want to apply to a set of elements matched by a selector.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are a lot of properties, and unfortunately we don't have time to teach
    even one tenth of them. But we will give you three highly useful properties.
    If you want to learn more, you can go to our Resources page and bookmark
    the links in the CSS section.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Text Color</h4>
  
  <p>
    You can set the text color for elements matched by a selector using the
    <code>color</code> property, such as <code>color: red;</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are a few ways to represent colors in CSS. Many colors can be named
    (such as red), see the Resources page for more details.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can also use a <b>rgb representation</b> if you want to fine-tune your
    colors, by representing the color using its red, green, and blue components.
    Each component can be a value between 0 and 255. Here is an example for
    dark gray:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
p {
  color: rgb(64, 64, 64);
}
  </code-block>
  
  <h4>Background Color</h4>
  
  <p>
    You can set the background color for elements matched by a selector using
    the <code>background-color</code> property, such as
    <code>background-color: black;</code>. Background colors can be represented
    the same way as text colors.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Text alignment</h4>
  
  <p>
    You can set the horizontal alignment of text in elements matched by a
    selector using the <code>text-align</code> property, such as
    <code>text-align: right;</code>. For this property, you can use
    <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>, or <code>right</code> as values.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
.right {
  text-align: right;
}
  </code-block>
