  <h1>HTML Basics</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p>
    <b>HTML</b> stands for <i>HyperText Markup Language</i>. It is the language
    we use to write content in web pages.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Structure of HTML</h2>
  
  <p>
    HTML is made up of <b>elements</b>, which are in turn composed of
    <b>tags</b> and <b>content</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A <i>tag</i> is written as one or more words within <i>angle brackets</i>,
    such as <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> or
    <code>&lt;a href="http://google.com"&gt;</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tags can enclose <i>content</i>, which may include text or more elements.
    When a tag has content inside of it, we usually need to write a <i>closing
    tag</i>. A closing tag looks similar to the tag that comes before the
    content, except that it has a leading forward slash. An example of a closing
    tag is <code>&lt;/b&gt;</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>Here are some example tags:</p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text. A "p" tag is used to mark a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;This is bold text, using a "b" tag.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some HTML elements can be used &lt;b&gt;inside&lt;/b&gt; of other elements!&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h2>Whitespace in HTML</h2>
  
  <p>
    Whitespace in the text between tags is collapsed:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p&gt;This paragraph will look the same as the others in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This      paragraph      will      look      the      same      as      the      others      in      a      browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  This
  paragraph
  will
  look
  the
  same
  as
  the
  others
  in
  a
  browser.
&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    When we have a lot of content inside a tag, it's always a good idea to add
    some spacing in the HTML file to make it readable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What about in tags themselves? That's a little more complicated. To be safe,
    just use single spaces inside tags:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">&lt;h1 class=&quot;spacing matters here&quot;&gt;Spacing     doesn't    matter here!&lt;/h1&gt;</code-block>
  
  <h2>Structure of an HTML Document</h2>
  
  <p>
    HTML documents have the same structure:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
    
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Document Type Declaration (<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>)</h3>
  
  <p>
    At the top of an HTML document is the <b>document type declaration</b>.
    This tells a web browser what kind of HTML is being used. This used to be
    very specific (and hard to remember), but for today's Web, you can just
    write <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Document Head</h3>
  
  <p>
    Below the document type declaration is the <b>document head</b>. Nothing in
    the document head is visible when a user views the page. The purpose of the
    document head section is to put in <i>metadata</i> about the page and to
    reference <i>stylesheets</i> and <i>scripts</i> that the page depends on.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The document head is where the <b>document title</b> is specified. The
    document title usually appears at the top of the browser window, outside of
    the page itself. We can choose a title using the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
    tag.
  </p>
  
  <p>Example title:</p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title Goes Here&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Document Body</h3>
  
  <p>
    Underneath the document head is the <b>document body</b>. This is where the
    main content of the page goes. We can use many different HTML tags to 
    present our content.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is a full example of a simple page:
  </p>
  
  <code-block>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Example Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      This is a paragraph on my web page.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Here is another one, with &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; text.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Below is how the page would roughly look in a browser:
  </p>
  
  <html-example>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    
    <p>This is a paragraph on my web page.</p>
    
    <p>
      Here is another one, with <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> text.
    </p>
  </html-example>
  
  <h2>Emphasizing Content</h2>
  
  <p>
    We have already seen two tags for emphasizing content: the
    <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> (bold) tag, and the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> (italic)
    tag. Just like in a word processor, bold text is darker and thicker, and
    italic text is artfully sloped.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can also write underlined text using a <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> tag.
    However, underlined text is very uncommon on the Web. In general, unless you
    are following a style guide which requires underlining certain things, you
    can just use bold and italic text.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For all three of these tags, simply use them around text that needs to be
    emphasized. This works in paragraphs and lists, as well as pretty much
    anywhere else. See below:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Emphasizing text&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This paragraph has &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text.
      This paragraph also has &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; text.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    <i><b>Warning:</b></i> You might be tempted to use bold or italic text on
    entire paragraphs to make them stand out. <i>Cascading style sheets</i>,
    which we will cover very soon, are much more efficient for that task.
  </p>
  
  <h1>Exercises</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Create a page with the title "Honey Badger", and with the following
      paragraphs in the body of the page:

      <p>
        The <b>honey badger</b> (<i>Mellivora capensis</i>) is the only species
        in the mustelid subfamily <b>Mellivorinae</b> and its only genus
        <b>Mellivora</b>. It is native to Africa, Southwest Asia, and the
        Indian subcontinent.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Despite its name, the honey badger does not closely resemble other
        badger species; instead, it bears more anatomical similarities to
        weasels. It is primarily a <i>carnivorous</i> species. It has few
        natural predators because of its thick skin and <i>ferocious</i>
        defensive abilities.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
