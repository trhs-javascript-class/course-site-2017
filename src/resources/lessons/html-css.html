  <h1>HTML &amp; CSS</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p>
    <b>HTML</b> stands for <i>HyperText Markup Language</i>. Put simply, it is
    the language we use to write content in web pages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>CSS</b> stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>. We use CSS in order to
    change the <i>presentation</i> of our content. This ties in very well with
    HTML, which contains our content and semantic structure; and it complements
    JavaScript, which is all about how the user interacts with our page.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Structure of HTML</h2>
  
  <p>
    HTML is made up of <b>elements</b>, which are in turn composed of
    <b>tags</b> and <b>content</b>. A <i>tag</i> is written as one or more words
    within <i>angle brackets</i>, such as <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> or
    <code>&lt;a href="http://google.com"&gt;</code>. Tags can enclose
    <i>content</i>, which may be text or more elements. When a tag has content
    inside of it, we usually need to write a <i>closing tag</i>, which is
    similar to the tag that comes before the content, except that it has a
    leading forward slash.
  </p>
  
  <p>Here are some examples:</p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text. A "p" tag is used to mark a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;This is bold text, using a "b" tag.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some HTML elements can be used &lt;b&gt;inside&lt;/b&gt; of other elements!&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h2>Whitespace in HTML</h2>
  
  <p>
    Whitespace in the text between tags is collapsed:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p&gt;This paragraph will look the same as the others in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This      paragraph      will      look      the      same      as      the      others      in      a      browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  This
  paragraph
  will
  look
  the
  same
  as
  the
  others
  in
  a
  browser.
&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    When we have a lot of content inside a tag, it's always a good idea to add
    some spacing in the HTML file to make it readable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What about in tags themselves? That's a little more complicated. To be safe,
    just use single spaces inside tags:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">&lt;h1 class=&quot;spacing matters&quot;&gt;Spacing     doesn't    matter here!&lt;/h1&gt;</code-block>
  
  <h2>Structure of an HTML Document</h2>
  
  <p>
    HTML documents have the same structure:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
    
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Document Type Declaration (<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>)</h3>
  
  <p>
    At the top of an HTML document is the <b>document type declaration</b>.
    This tells a web browser what kind of HTML is being used. This used to be
    very specific, but it is sufficient to write <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
    for modern HTML.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Document Head</h3>
  
  <p>
    Below the document type declaration is the <b>document head</b>. Nothing in
    the document head is visible when a user views the page. The purpose of the
    document head section is to put in <i>metadata</i> about the page and to
    reference <i>stylesheets</i> and <i>scripts</i> that the page depends on.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The document head is where the <b>document title</b> is specified. The
    document title usually appears at the top of the browser window, outside of
    the page itself. We can choose a title using the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
    tag.
  </p>
  
  <p>Example title:</p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title Goes Here&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Document Body</h3>
  
  <p>
    Underneath the document head is the <b>document body</b>. This is where the
    main content of the page goes. There are a decent number of HTML tags we can
    use to present our content. Most of them are pretty simple, don't worry.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is a full example of a simple page:
  </p>
  
  <code-block>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Example Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      This is a paragraph on my web page.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Here is another one, with &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; text.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Below is how the page would roughly look in a (small) browser:
  </p>
  
  <html-example>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    
    <p>This is a paragraph on my web page.</p>
    
    <p>
      Here is another one, with <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> text.
    </p>
  </html-example>
  
  <h2>Presenting Content</h2>
  
  <p>
    We have already mentioned that <i>paragraphs</i> of text can be represented
    with the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. Here are a few other ways to organize
    text:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Unordered lists</li>
    <li>Ordered lists</li>
    <li>Grouped via headers</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Unordered lists</h3>
  
  <p>
    There are three types of lists in HTML: <b>unordered lists</b>,
    <b>ordered lists</b>, and <b>definition lists</b>. Of these, only the first
    two are commonly used, so we won't mention definition lists again.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <i>Unordered lists</i> are lists where the order of the content is not
    particularly important. These are represented as <i>bullet lists</i>, such
    as the one above the beginning of this section.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unordered lists are surrounded by a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> opening tag and
    a <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code> closing tag. (Think &quot;ul&quot; equals
    &quot;unordered list&quot;.) Each list item is surrounded by a
    <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> opening tag and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> closing
    tag.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p&gt;Key ingredients in apple juice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apples&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Juice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bunch of preservatives and additives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Unordered lists</h3>
  
  <p>
    <i>Ordered lists</i>, in contrast, are lists where the order of the content
    is important. These are represented as <i>numbered lists</i>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ordered lists are surrounded by a <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> opening tag and
    a <code>&lt;/ol&gt;</code> closing tag. (Think &quot;ol&quot; equals
    &quot;ordered list*quot;.) Each list item is surrounded by a
    <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> opening tag and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> closing
    tag, just like in unordered lists.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p&gt;How to make apple juice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acquire some apples.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut the skin off the apples using a paring knife.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut the core out of the apples using a paring knife.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the apple slices into a food processor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add juice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add additives and preservatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    <b><i>Disclaimer:</i></b> This is not a cooking class and we make no
    representation of the accuracy of any cooking suggestions.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Headers</h3>
  
  <p>
    There are six different header tags, each representing a different level
    of heading for your content:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;h5&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;h6&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;</code></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Higher header numbers mean levels of subheading/nesting. In other words,
    <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is biggest and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> is smallest.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can use headers to intelligently group text together, and even to put
    groups in a larger group. In fact, we are using <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
    through <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> on this page to group all of the content
    together!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of how you can use headers to group content:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;All About Apple Juice
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Everything I Know About Apple Juice&lt;/h1&gt;
    
    &lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Key ingredients in apple juice:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Apples&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Juice&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A bunch of preservatives and additives&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    
    &lt;h2&gt;Making Apple Juice&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;How to make apple juice:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Acquire some apples.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cut the skin off the apples using a paring knife.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cut the core out of the apples using a paring knife.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Put the apple slices into a food processor.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add juice.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add additives and preservatives.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Which would look something like this in a browser:
  </p>
  
  <html-example>
    <h1>Everything I Know About Apple Juice</h1>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <p>Key ingredients in apple juice:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Apples</li>
      <li>Juice</li>
      <li>A bunch of preservatives and additives</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Making Apple Juice</h2>
    
    <p>How to make apple juice:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Acquire some apples.</li>

      <li>Add juice.</li>
      <li>Add additives and preservatives.</li>
    </ol>
  </html-example>
  
  <h2>Emphasizing Content</h2>
  
  <p>
    We have already seen two tags for emphasizing content: the
    <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> (bold) tag, and the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> (italic)
    tag. Just like in a word processor, bold text is darker and thicker, and
    italic text is artfully sloped.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can also write underlined text using a <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> tag.
    However, underlined text is very uncommon on the Web. In general, unless you
    are following a style guide which requires underlining certain things, you
    can just use bold and italic text.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For all three of these tags, simply use them around text that needs to be
    emphasized. This works in paragraphs and lists, as well as pretty much
    anywhere else. See below:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Emphasizing text&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This paragraph has &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text.
      This paragraph also has &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; text.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Something &lt;b&gt;important.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Another&lt;/i&gt; important thing.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    <i><b>Warning:</b></i> It might be tempting to use bold or italic text on
    entire paragraphs to make them stand out. If we can't convince you that
    "less is more" when it comes to content emphasis, at least let us convince
    you not to use the tags. <i>Cascading style sheets</i>, which we will cover
    very soon, are much more efficient for that task.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Linking to Different Pages</h2>
  
  <p>
    Everything we have done so far has helped us write content onto a single
    page. While there is nothing stopping you from writing your autobiography
    onto a single web page, it's a much better idea to separate your content
    into multiple pages. That way, you can control how you want to present each
    page, and you can even make suggestions to your users about what content to
    view next, but your users have the freedom to browse your content in the
    way that makes the most sense to them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That's beautiful and all, but there's no point in separating your content
    into different pages if your users can't jump between those pages. Enter
    <b>hyperlinks</b>, or <b>links</b> for short. HTML's greatest strength is
    its ability to seamlessly link content pages together. This is primary done
    using the <b>anchor tag</b> (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let's start with an example:
    <code>&lt;a href="http://google.com"&gt;Google!&lt;/a&gt;</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first thing you might have noticed is the extra stuff in the opening
    <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag. That is an <b>attribute</b>, which is used for
    giving web browsers extra information about the element without showing it
    directly to the user. One thing to note about attributes is that they never
    are used in a closing tag, only in an opening tag.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In this case, the <i>href attribute</i> tells a web browser what page it
    should show the user next if the user clicks on the hyperlink. The
    <i>text</i> of a hyperlink is completely irrelevant in determining the
    page the user sees when he or she clicks on the link.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For example, the link below will <i>not</i> take the user to the Trustworthy
    Bank:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;a href="http://fraudsters.com"&gt;My Trustworthy Bank Account&lt;/a&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Building hyperlinks that go to unexpected websites is one of the more basic
    techniques cyber-criminals use to try to trick people into sharing private
    information. Make sure your friends and family know to hover over links and
    read the web address in the corner of the browser before clicking!
  </p>
  
  <h3>Pointing to Different Pages</h3>
  
  <p>
    We've seen that the <i>href attribute</i> of an <i>anchor tag</i> is how we
    direct users to other pages. But how can we specify those pages? The answer
    is we use one of three different kinds of <b>URLs</b> (uniform resource
    locators):
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      An <b>absolute URL</b> is a long URL that includes the <i>hostname</i>
      for a site, as well as the full <i>path</i> to the desired page or
      resource. (Example: <code>http://github.com/platinumazure</code>)
    </li>
    <li>
      A <b>virtual URL</b> is a URL that begins with a forward slash. Virtual
      URLs resolve to a URL on the same <i>hostname</i>, but replace the entire
      <i>path</i>. For example, if you are currently visiting
      <code>https://github.com/weegeekps</code>, a link with href of
      <code>/platinumazure</code> would take you to the
      <code>https://github.com/platinumazure</code> page.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <b>relative URL</b> is a URL that is interpreted as <i>relative to</i>
      the current page.
    </li>
  </ul>
      
  <p>
    There are a few different flavors of relative URLs:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>../../some/other/path</code>: Go "up" two levels of the path
      (remove the two rightmost path segments), then add the some/other/path
      segments. <code>http://example.com/foo/bar</code> becomes
      <code>http://example.com/some/other/path</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>./somePage.html</code>: Look for "somePage.html" with the same
      path segments as the current page (up to the last segment).
      <code>http://example.com/foo/bar.html</code> becomes
      <code>http://example.com/foo/somePage.html</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>somePage.html</code> (with no dots or slashes prefixing): This
      is the same as <code>./somePage.html</code>, in that it uses the path
      segments of your current page except the last segment.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Which type is the correct one to use? Well, that depends on the situation.
    An <i>external link</i>, which is a hyperlink going to a different website,
    must use an absolute URL. When you don't want to use an absolute URL, either
    a virtual URL or a relative URL will work just fine (and in general, as long
    as you don't move your website to a different hostname, it is possible to
    convert between virtual and relative URLs interchangeably).
  </p>
  
  <h2>Images</h2>
  
  <p>
    We can render images on our web pages using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
    tag. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag requires a <code>src</code> attribute
    (meaning source). The value of the <code>src</code> attribute is a URL,
    meaning any of the URL types we just learned about will work here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/download/GthfGaz" /&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Which looks something like this:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <img src="http://imgur.com/download/GthfGaz" />
  </p>
  
  <h2>Using CSS to Style Your Content</h2>
  
  <p>
    Before we talk about how to actually style our pages through CSS, we need to
    talk about where we can use styles.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are three types of styles:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Inline styles</li>
    <li>Embedded styles</li>
    <li>External styles</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Inline Styles</h3>
  
  <p>
    <b>Inline styles</b> are styles that are applied directly to HTML elements.
    We can use the <code>style</code> attribute on any element to style just
    that element.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here's an example of an inline style:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p style="color: red"&gt;The text in this paragraph is red.&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Embedded Styles</h3>
  
  <p>
    If you want all of your paragraphs to have red text, you can see that it
    will get really frustrating really quickly to use inline styles on all
    paragraphs. Wouldn't it be great if we could just say that all paragraphs
    should be red? <b>Embedded styles</b> allow you to do just that.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Embedded styles are put onto the page using a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
    tag. We use a <code>type</code> attribute in the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
    tag to tell the browser we are using CSS. Then we can write our styles in
    the form of <i>CSS rules</i>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of a CSS rule in an embedded style sheet:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
      p {
        color: red;
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow! This paragraph will have red text, without having to write a color
      inside the HTML.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And so will this paragraph!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And this one!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>External Styles</h3>
  
  <p>
    Embedded style sheets do a great job of providing a consistent set of styles
    across a page. When you want to use the same styles across an entire
    website, though, <b>external styles</b> are the way to go.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    External styles are very similar to embedded styles. The only difference is
    where the style rules are located. For external styles, we write our style
    rules in a <code>.css</code> file and then pull the file into our pages
    using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag. (Be careful: We use the &lt;a&gt;
    or <i>anchor</i> tag for creating hyperlinks. The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
    tag is for pulling two resources together&mdash;in this case, an HTML
    document and an external CSS file.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is how the above example would look using external styles:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
/* This is the CSS file. (This line is a comment, which doesn't do anything.) */

p {
  color: red;
}
  </code-block>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;

      Wow! This paragraph will have red text, without having to write a color
      inside the HTML.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And so will this paragraph!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      And this one!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

  <p>
    Most of the time, external styles are the best way to do things. CSS files
    can be pulled in easily from HTML pages, and they help ensure consistent
    styles across your website.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Anatomy of a CSS Rule</h2>
  
  <p>
    As we mentioned earlier, styles are expressed in terms of <b>CSS rules</b>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A CSS rule has two parts. First is the <b>selector</b>, which describes the
    elements to which the styles will be applied. After the selector comes the
    <b>properties</b>, which are actual styles that will be applied to elements
    that match the rule's selector. Properties are surrounded by curly braces.
    Each property is composed of a name and a value, separated by a colon.
    Each property is terminated by a semicolon.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Selectors</h3>
  
  <p>
    There are many different types of selectors. In this class, we will show
    only three types of selectors to keep things simple. We guarantee that these
    three types of selectors will cover 85% or more of all situations you will
    encounter as a web developer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are the three types of selectors we will focus on:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Tag selectors</li>
    <li>Class selectors</li>
    <li>ID selectors</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Tag selectors</h4>
  
  <p>
    <b>Tag selectors</b> are selectors that match elements by their tag name.
    We saw a tag selector in a recent example: <code>p</code>. This selector
    matches all elements that have <i>p</i> as their tag name: in other words,
    paragraph tags.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rules with tag selectors are useful when you want to apply styles to many
    elements with the same HTML tag. In addition, you can apply styles to the
    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag in order to apply styles to the entire page.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Class selectors</h4>
  
  <p>
    <b>Class selectors</b> are selectors that match elements by their class
    name. But wait, what is a class name?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A <b>class name</b> is an attribute we can assign to any HTML element. We
    can use class names in order to classify HTML elements (possibly with
    different tag names) as needing the same styles applied.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We can use almost any string as a class name (as long as it doesn't have a
    space in it). We can use hyphens to create a class name with multiple words.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some example classes:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><code>red</code></li>
    <li><code>important-info</code></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Classes are specified using the <code>class</code> attribute on any element:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p class="my-class"&gt;This paragraph has class.&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Class names don't do anything by themselves. If all you do is put a class
    attribute on every element in your HTML, nothing will look any different.
    The real power of classes comes from using classes in CSS rules.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of a rule that uses a class selector:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
.red {
  color: red;
}
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    A class selector starts with a <code>.</code> (period), and that is followed
    by the name of the class you want to trigger this style rule. Any style
    properties declared in the rule will be applied to all elements with a
    matching class name.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By the way, HTML elements can have more than once class name. Multiple
    class names are separated with spaces:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p class="red bold"&gt;A paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    When an element has multiple class names, it will be affected by rules
    that mention only one or some of its classes. For example, a rule with a
    <code>.red</code> selector will be applied to the paragraph above, and so
    will a rule with a <code>.bold</code> selector. Therefore, you should use
    multiple classes with simple style meanings ("red" and "bold" individually)
    rather than one class with a more complex style meaning ("redbold" which
    means both). That way, you can just use both classes, like we did above.
  </p>
  
  <h4>ID selectors</h4>
  
  <p>
    <b>ID selectors</b> are similar to class selectors. Elements can be given an
    ID using the <code>id</code> attribute. The major difference between an ID
    and a class name is that an element can only have one ID&mdash;and also, no
    two HTML elements can have the same ID on the same page.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of an element with an ID:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p id="some-id"&gt;My paragraph with an identity&lt;/p&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    And here is an example of a style rule using an ID selector:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
#some-id {
  color: red;
}
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    An ID selector starts with a <code>#</code> (<s>hashtag</s> hash symbol),
    and that is followed by the name of the class you want to trigger this style
    rule. Any style properties declared in the rule will be applied to the one
    element with the ID used in the rule.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Properties</h3>
  
  <p>
    In a CSS rule, <b>properties</b> are how we describe the actual styles we
    want to apply to a set of elements matched by a selector.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are a lot of properties, and unfortunately we don't have time to teach
    even one tenth of them. But we will give you three highly useful properties.
    If you want to learn more, you can go to our Resources page and bookmark
    the links in the CSS section.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Text Color</h4>
  
  <p>
    You can set the text color for elements matched by a selector using the
    <code>color</code> property, such as <code>color: red;</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are a few ways to represent colors in CSS. Many colors can be named
    (such as red), see the Resources page for more details.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can also use a <b>rgb representation</b> if you want to fine-tune your
    colors, by representing the color using its red, green, and blue components.
    Each component can be a value between 0 and 255. Here is an example for
    dark gray:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
p {
  color: rgb(64, 64, 64);
}
  </code-block>
  
  <h4>Background Color</h4>
  
  <p>
    You can set the background color for elements matched by a selector using
    the <code>background-color</code> property, such as
    <code>background-color: black;</code>. Background colors can be represented
    the same way as text colors.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Text alignment</h4>
  
  <p>
    You can set the horizontal alignment of text in elements matched by a
    selector using the <code>text-align</code> property, such as
    <code>text-align: right;</code>. For this property, you can use
    <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>, or <code>right</code> as values.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="css">
.right {
  text-align: right;
}
  </code-block>
