  <h1>More HTML</h1>
  
  <h2>Organizing Content</h2>
  
  <p>
    We have already mentioned that <i>paragraphs</i> of text can be represented
    with the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. Here are a few other ways to organize
    text:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Unordered lists</li>
    <li>Ordered lists</li>
    <li>Grouped via headers</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Unordered lists</h3>
  
  <p>
    There are three types of lists in HTML: <b>unordered lists</b>,
    <b>ordered lists</b>, and <b>definition lists</b>. Of these, only the first
    two are commonly used, so we won't mention definition lists again.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <i>Unordered lists</i> are lists where the order of the content is not
    particularly important. These are represented as <i>bullet lists</i>, such
    as the one above the beginning of this section.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unordered lists are surrounded by a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> opening tag and
    a <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code> closing tag. ("ul" is short for "unordered
    list".) Each list item is surrounded by a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> opening
    tag and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> closing tag. ("li" is short for "list
    item".)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p&gt;Key ingredients in apple juice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apples&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Juice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bunch of preservatives and additives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Ordered lists</h3>
  
  <p>
    <i>Ordered lists</i>, on the other hand, are lists where the order of the
    content is important. These are represented as <i>numbered lists</i>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ordered lists are surrounded by a <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> opening tag and
    a <code>&lt;/ol&gt;</code> closing tag. (Think "ol" equals "ordered list".)
    Each list item is surrounded by a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> opening tag and
    <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> closing tag, just like in unordered lists.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;p&gt;How to make apple juice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acquire some apples.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut the skin off the apples using a paring knife.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut the core out of the apples using a paring knife.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the apple slices into a food processor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add juice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add additives and preservatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <h3>Headers</h3>
  
  <p>
    There are six different header tags, each representing a different level
    of heading for your content:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;h5&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>&lt;h6&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;</code></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag represents a main-level header. h2 is a
    subheader, and higher numbers are even deeper subheaders. Visually,
    <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is biggest and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> is smallest.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can use headers to group text together, and even to put groups in a
    larger group. In fact, we are using <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> through
    <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> on this page to group all of the content together!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of how you can use headers to group content:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;All About Apple Juice
  &lt;/head&gt;
  
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Everything I Know About Apple Juice&lt;/h1&gt;
    
    &lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Key ingredients in apple juice:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Apples&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Juice&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A bunch of preservatives and additives&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    
    &lt;h2&gt;Making Apple Juice&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;How to make apple juice:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Acquire some apples.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cut the skin off the apples using a paring knife.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Cut the core out of the apples using a paring knife.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Put the apple slices into a food processor.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add juice.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add additives and preservatives.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Which would look something like this in a browser:
  </p>
  
  <html-example>
    <h1>Everything I Know About Apple Juice</h1>

  <h2>Linking to Different Pages</h2>
  
  <p>
    Everything we have done so far has helped us write content onto a single
    page. While there is nothing stopping you from writing your autobiography
    onto a single web page, it's a much better idea to separate your content
    into multiple pages. That way, you can control how you want to present each
    page, and you can even make suggestions to your users about what content to
    view next, but your users have the freedom to browse your content in the
    way that makes the most sense to them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That's beautiful and all, but there's no point in separating your content
    into different pages if your users can't jump between those pages. Enter
    <b>hyperlinks</b>, or <b>links</b> for short. HTML's greatest strength is
    its ability to seamlessly link content pages together. This is primary done
    using the <b>anchor tag</b> (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let's start with an example:
    <code>&lt;a href="http://google.com"&gt;Google!&lt;/a&gt;</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first thing you might have noticed is the extra stuff in the opening
    <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag. That is an <b>attribute</b>, which is used for
    giving web browsers extra information about the element without showing it
    directly to the user. One thing to note about attributes is that they never
    are used in a closing tag, only in an opening tag.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In this case, the <i>href attribute</i> tells a web browser what page it
    should show the user next if the user clicks on the hyperlink. The
    <i>text</i> of a hyperlink is completely irrelevant in determining the
    page the user sees when he or she clicks on the link.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For example, the link below will <i>not</i> take the user to the Trustworthy
    Bank:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;a href="http://fraudsters.com"&gt;My Trustworthy Bank Account&lt;/a&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Building hyperlinks that go to unexpected websites is one of the more basic
    techniques cyber-criminals use to try to trick people into sharing private
    information. Make sure your friends and family know to hover over links and
    read the web address in the corner of the browser before clicking!
  </p>
  
  <h3>Pointing to Different Pages</h3>
  
  <p>
    We've seen that the <i>href attribute</i> of an <i>anchor tag</i> is how we
    direct users to other pages. But how can we specify those pages? The answer
    is we use one of three different kinds of <b>URLs</b> (uniform resource
    locators):
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      An <b>absolute URL</b> is a long URL that includes the <i>hostname</i>
      for a site, as well as the full <i>path</i> to the desired page or
      resource. (Example: <code>http://github.com/platinumazure</code>)
    </li>
    <li>
      A <b>virtual URL</b> is a URL that begins with a forward slash. Virtual
      URLs resolve to a URL on the same <i>hostname</i>, but replace the entire
      <i>path</i>. For example, if you are currently visiting
      <code>https://github.com/weegeekps</code>, a link with href of
      <code>/platinumazure</code> would take you to the
      <code>https://github.com/platinumazure</code> page.
    </li>
    <li>
      A <b>relative URL</b> is a URL that is interpreted as <i>relative to</i>
      the current page.
    </li>
  </ul>
      
  <p>
    There are a few different flavors of relative URLs:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>../../some/other/path</code>: Go "up" two levels of the path
      (remove the two rightmost path segments), then add the some/other/path
      segments. <code>http://example.com/foo/bar</code> becomes
      <code>http://example.com/some/other/path</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>./somePage.html</code>: Look for "somePage.html" with the same
      path segments as the current page (up to the last segment).
      <code>http://example.com/foo/bar.html</code> becomes
      <code>http://example.com/foo/somePage.html</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>somePage.html</code> (with no dots or slashes prefixing): This
      is the same as <code>./somePage.html</code>, in that it uses the path
      segments of your current page except the last segment.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Which type is the correct one to use? Well, that depends on the situation.
    An <i>external link</i>, which is a hyperlink going to a different website,
    must use an absolute URL. When you don't want to use an absolute URL, either
    a virtual URL or a relative URL will work just fine (and in general, as long
    as you don't move your website to a different hostname, it is possible to
    convert between virtual and relative URLs interchangeably).
  </p>
  
  <h2>Images</h2>
  
  <p>
    We can render images on our web pages using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
    tag. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag requires a <code>src</code> attribute
    (meaning source). The value of the <code>src</code> attribute is a URL,
    meaning any of the URL types we just learned about will work here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example:
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="html">
&lt;img src="http://imgur.com/download/GthfGaz" /&gt;
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    Which looks something like this:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <img src="http://imgur.com/download/GthfGaz" />
