  <h1>Loops</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>In this lesson we are learning about another essential <b>control
  structure</b> in the JavaScript programming language. A <b>loop</b> is a
  sequence of instructions that are repeated until a condition is reached. If
  you've used other programming languages such as C++ or Java before, you may
  be familiar with some of these loops. We will be using <b>arrays</b>, which
  we learned last lesson, heavily here.</p>

  <!-- While -->
  <h2>While</h2>

  <p>The <code>while</code> loop is the most basic loop that we can use in
  JavaScript. <b>While</b> loops take a <b>condition</b> and continue to perform the
  actions within it's <b>block</b> as long as the condition evaluates to true.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">let iterator = 0;

while (iterator < myPets.length) {
  iterator += 1;
  console.log(myPets[iterator]);
}

// Output is:
//   cat
//   dog</code-block>

  <p>When using a <code>while</code> loop with a conditional it's important to
  make sure to increment your iterator. If you don't you can end up in a
  situation where you have an <b>infinite loop</b>! When this happens, you will
  crash your user's environment or browser.</p>

  <p>Another important part about <code>while</code> loops is that the condition
  is <b>evaluated</b> <i>before</i> the block is executed. What if we want to
  evaluate a condition <i>after</i> we execute our block?</p>

  <!-- Do While -->
  <h2>Do While</h2>

  <p>For situations where we want to evaluate our condition after we execute
  our code we can use a <code>do-while</code> loop. These are identical to
  <code>while</code> loops except that the block executes before the condition
  is evaluated.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">let iterator = 0;

do {
  iterator += 1;
  console.log(myPets[iterator]);
} while (iterator < myPets.length)

// Output is:
//   dog
//   undefined</code-block>

  <p>That's not right! The output should have been <i>cat</i> and <i>dog</i>!
  However we <b>incremented</b> our iterator prior to attempting to print out
  our pets. On the first call to <code>console.log</code> the value of iterator
  is actually 1 rather than 0. We can fix this by simply moving our call to
  increment below our <code>console.log</code> call.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">let iterator = 0;

do {
  console.log(myPets[iterator]);
  iterator += 1;
} while (iterator < myPets.length)

// Output is:
//   cat
//   dog</code-block>

  <!-- For -->
  <h2>For</h2>

  <p>The last kind of loop we're going to look at is the <code>for</code> loop.
  This loop is likely the most used loop and easily the most versatile. It works
  identical to the while loop in that it evaluates the condition before executing
  the block of code, but it provides a shorter syntax that is easier to type and
  read. It also provides <b>scoping</b> for our iterator, so we can reuse it.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">// A common convention is to use i for the iterator in for loops.

for (let i = 0; i < myPets.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(myPets[i]);
}

// Output is:
//   cat
//   dog</code-block>

  <p>In the code example above we have declared a <code>for</code> loop that
  performs identically to our <code>while</code> loop. In the first line we see
  3 pieces passed in; first a declaration of what we want to use as an iterator.
  Second, we declare our condition for running, this is identical to the
  condition we used before. Finally we have our increment call.</p>

  <p>With a <code>for</code> loop we can always rest assured that our iterator
  will always be incremented <i>after</i> our work is complete, so we can avoid
  situations like we had with the <code>do while</code> loop.</p>

  <h1>Exercises</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>Write an array named <i>pets</i> with the following information.
    <ul>
      <li>cat</li>
      <li>dog</li>
      <li>pig</li>
      <li>bird</li>
      <li>hamster</li>
      <li>badger</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a <code>while</code> loop that prints out all of our <code>pets</code> array.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create another loop, this time a <code>for</code> loop that does the same
      thing as our <code>while</code> loop in the last exercise.
    </li>
  </ol>
