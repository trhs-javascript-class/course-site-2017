  <h1>Setup</h1>
  
  <p>
    We will be using <b>Cloud9</b> as our development environment. Cloud9 is an
    awesome web-based development environment that you can access from anywhere.
    We even used it in order to prepare curriculum for this class at home,
    work, and elsewhere.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One drawback of Cloud9 is that they ask for a credit card number on sign-up,
    even for us as we use their free plan. So we will be creating an account on
    <b>GitHub</b> in order to work around that. GitHub is a cloud-based
    <i>source control tool</i>, but we won't be using it very much in this class
    except as a way of signing onto Cloud9.
  </p>
  
  <p class="aside">
    If you're wondering what's with all these mentions of clouds, this is
    because <i>the cloud</i> refers to websites and remote file storage systems
    that allow us to do our work remotely. The Cloud9 website's name is a pun
    on the expression <i>on cloud nine</i>, which refers to a feeling of
    contentment or happiness.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are the things we need to do in order to get ready to code:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Create a GitHub account</li>
    <li>Use the GitHub account to sign onto Cloud9</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Creating a GitHub Account</h2>
  
  <p>
    Follow these steps to create an account on GitHub:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>.</li>
    <li>
      Fill out the signup form on the home page with a username, your e-mail
      address, and a password.
    </li>
    <li>Select the Free plan, and click "Finish sign up".</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    Next, you will have a chance to verify your e-mail address. Please make sure
    to do this step, as you will not be able to authorize Cloud9 using your
    GitHub account if you don't do this.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Make sure to stay signed in</b> to GitHub for the next set of steps.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Signing up for Cloud9</h2>
  
  <p>
    Follow these steps to create an account on Cloud9:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Go to <a href="http://c9.io">http://c9.io</a>.</li>
    <li>
      Click the cat icon near the upper right corner.
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the upper right corner, look for a white circle surrounding an
          outline of a cat. (When you mouse over it, it should say "Sign in with
          GitHub".)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      You may be redirected to GitHub and asked to sign in there. If so, sign in
      with the username and password you created on that site.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may be asked to authorize Cloud9 to use your GitHub account. If so,
      click the button that authorizes Cloud9 to use your GitHub account.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Creating your Workspace</h2>
  
  <p>
    Once you have fully signed in to Cloud9, the next thing we need to do is to
    create a workspace. Click on the "Create a new workspace" button to start
    that process.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For <i>Workspace name</i>, just put something like "tr-web-programming", and
    for the <i>Description</i>, just put something like "I am so looking forward
    to this class". We're kidding&mdash;put whatever you like.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Choose "Hosted workspace", then choose "Public". (Don't worry, you won't be
    putting anything important into your code.) Skip the "Clone from..."
    section and choose the Blank template. Then, click "Create workspace" to
    finish up.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Installing Node.js</h2>
  
  <p>
    Okay, actually, we already have Node.js available&mdash;the problem is that
    we don't have the latest version.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Make sure you have a <code>bash</code> <i>terminal window</i> open. Then
    run the following commands one at a time (don't type <code>$</code>, that's
    just a symbol for a command prompt):
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="bash">
$ nvm install 6.3.0
$ nvm use 6.3.0
$ nvm alias default 6.3.0
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    And with that, you should be ready to go!
  </p>
