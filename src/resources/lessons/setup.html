  <h1>Setup</h1>
  
  <p>
    We will be using <b>Cloud9</b> as our development environment. Cloud9 is an
    awesome web-based development environment that you can access from anywhere.
    We even used it in order to prepare curriculum for this class at home,
    work, and elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will need access to an email account in order to do this. If you don't
    have access to one here, please let Adam or Kevin know ASAP.

    team.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Creating your Workspace</h2>
  
  <p>
    Once you have fully signed in to Cloud9, the next thing we need to do is to
    create a workspace. Click on the "Create a new workspace" button to start
    that process.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For <i>Workspace name</i>, just put something like "tr-web-programming", and
    for the <i>Description</i>, just put something like "I am so looking forward
    to this class". We're kidding&mdash;put whatever you like.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Choose "Hosted workspace", then choose "Public". (Don't worry, you won't be
    putting anything important into your code.) Skip the "Clone from..."
    section and choose the Blank template. Then, click "Create workspace" to
    finish up.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Installing Node.js</h2>
  
  <p>
    Okay, actually, we already have Node.js available&mdash;the problem is that
    we don't have the latest version.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Make sure you have a <code>bash</code> <i>terminal window</i> open. Then
    run the following commands one at a time (don't type <code>$</code>, that's
    just a symbol for a command prompt):
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="bash">
$ nvm install 8.11.3
$ nvm use 8.11.3
$ nvm alias default 8.11.3
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    And with that, you should be ready to go!
  </p>

  <h2>Optional: Installing ESLint</h2>

  <p>
    ESLint is a code quality tool that looks at JavaScript code to identify
    potential problems. We can use ESLint to help troubleshoot when code isn't
    working how it should.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can install ESLint by following these steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Run this command in the terminal window: <code>npm install -g eslint</code></li>
    <li>Create a new file called <i>.eslintrc.json</i> (note the dot at the beginning)</li>
    <li>
      Open the file and copy the following code block into the file:

      <code-block language="json">{
    "extends": "eslint:recommended",
    "root": true
}</code-block>
    </li>
    <li>Save the file.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Using ESLint to Find Problems</h3>

  <p>
    If you're having trouble getting code to work, you can try running ESLint
    on the file you're working on:
  </p>

  <code-block language="bash">$ eslint path/to/my/file.js</code-block>

  <p>
    Where <i>path/to/my/file.js</i> is a path to the file you are working on.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you see no output, that means ESLint found no problems. Otherwise,
    ESLint will print a message for each issue it finds.
  </p>
