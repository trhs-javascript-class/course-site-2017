  <h1>Setup</h1>
  
  <p>
    We will be using <b>Cloud9</b> as our development environment. Cloud9 is an
    awesome web-based development environment that you can access from anywhere.
    We even used it in order to prepare curriculum for this class at home,
    work, and elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p>You will need access to an email account in order to do this. If you don't have access to one here, please
  let Adam or Kevin know ASAP.</p>
  
  <p class="aside">
    If you're wondering what's with all these mentions of clouds, this is
    because <i>the cloud</i> refers to websites and remote file storage systems
    that allow us to do our work remotely. The Cloud9 website's name is a pun
    on the expression <i>on cloud nine</i>, which refers to a feeling of
    contentment or happiness.
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Please follow along with Adam to set up your Cloud9 account.</b></p>
  
  <h2>Creating your Workspace</h2>
  
  <p>
    Once you have fully signed in to Cloud9, the next thing we need to do is to
    create a workspace. Click on the "Create a new workspace" button to start
    that process.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For <i>Workspace name</i>, just put something like "tr-web-programming", and
    for the <i>Description</i>, just put something like "I am so looking forward
    to this class". We're kidding&mdash;put whatever you like.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Choose "Hosted workspace", then choose "Public". (Don't worry, you won't be
    putting anything important into your code.) Skip the "Clone from..."
    section and choose the Blank template. Then, click "Create workspace" to
    finish up.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Installing Node.js</h2>
  
  <p>
    Okay, actually, we already have Node.js available&mdash;the problem is that
    we don't have the latest version.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Make sure you have a <code>bash</code> <i>terminal window</i> open. Then
    run the following commands one at a time (don't type <code>$</code>, that's
    just a symbol for a command prompt):
  </p>
  
  <code-block language="bash">
$ nvm install 6.3.0
$ nvm use 6.3.0
$ nvm alias default 6.3.0
  </code-block>
  
  <p>
    And with that, you should be ready to go!
