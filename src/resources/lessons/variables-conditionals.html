  <h1>Variables &amp; Conditionals</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Variables &amp; conditionals are a cornerstone of all modern software
  development. <b>Variables</b> allow us to make our programs store
  information and perform actions on that information. <b>Conditionals</b>
  allow us to make branching decisions based on comparisons and other actions
  performed against variables.</p>

  <p>In this lesson you will be learning about both of these important tools.
  Please go step by step through each section and do not be afraid to ask
  Adam or Kevin questions.</p>

  <h2>Variables</h2>

  <b>Variables</b> in the latest version of JavaScript come in three distinct
  flavors. In the code block below we have declared three variables, each using
  a different <i>declaration keyword.</i> We must always use one of these
  keywords when declaring a new variables. Each keyword has a different
  <b>scope</b>. Scoping allows us to limit where that variable can be seen, but
  we will go more into that in a moment.

  <code-block language="javascript">// The first two are the most important ones!

// This declares a variable in local block scope.
let localVariable;

// This declares a variable in local block scope that cannot be changed.
// We have to assign it a value when we declare it.
const constantVariable = 'stuff';

// This declares a variable in global scope, sometimes.
// You should avoid using this last one as much as possible.
var globalVariable;</code-block>

  <p>Make note of the warning about the <code>var</code> keyword. Sometimes this
  keyword will declare your variable in a <i>global</i> scope, but other times
  it will declare within a <i>local block</i> scope. Confused? That's why it's not
  recommended for use by anyone.</p>

  <p>Most scoping in JavaScript uses what is called <b>block scoping</b>. A
  <b>block</b> is the code between two curly braces.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">// Use { and } to define a block.

// Outside the block.

{
  // Inside the block.
}</code-block>

  <p>JavaScript uses blocks for all sorts of control structures. Variables
  declared inside a block using <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> can only
  be accessed from within that block. However, variables declared outside of the
  block can be accessed from within a block. The example below demonstrates this.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">let outsideVariable = 'foo';

console.log(outsideVariable); // Output: foo

{
  console.log(outsideVariable); // Output: foo

  let insideVariable = 'bar';

  console.log(insideVariable); // Output: bar
}

console.log(insideVariable); // Output: ReferenceError: insideVariable is not defined</code-block>

  <p>Beware of reusing variable names inside of your blocks. If you declare a
  variable named <code>cat</code> with the value <code>"meow"</code> outside of
  a block, then declared another variable also named <code>cat</code> with the
  value <code>"bark"</code> it may become confusing to understand your code.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">let cat = "meow";

console.log(cat); // Output: meow

{
  console.log(cat); // Output: meow

  let cat = "bark";

  console.log(cat); // Output: bark
}

console.log(cat); // Output: meow</code-block>

  <p>Variables alone don't make for useful programs. In order to create useful
  programs we need to be able to make decisions on the values stored in our
  variables. We call these <b>control structures</b>. The first of these that we
  will be looking at are called <b>conditionals</b>.</p>

  <h2>Conditionals</h2>

  <p><b>Conditionals</b> perform different actions based on the state of a
  <b>boolean</b> value. <b>Booleans</b> can be either true or false. We can
  assign our variables a <b>boolean</b> value using the <code>true</code> or
  <code>false</code> keywords, or we can use a <b>comparison operator</b> to
  create a boolean based on the conditions of a variable.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">// Equality comparison operators

let foo = true;

// === checks to see if two values are equal.
// !== checks to see if two values are NOT equal.

console.log(foo === true); // Output: true

console.log(foo !== true); // Output: false

console.log(foo === 'bar'); // Output: false</code-block>

  <p>We can compare numbers, strings, booleans, variables, and even objects in
  JavaScript. When comparing numbers there are several other <b>comparison
  operators</b> that are useful for us.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">// Relational comparison operators

let foo = 3;
let bar = 6;
let three = 3;

// > checks to see if the first value is greater than the second.
// >= checks to see if the first value is greater than or equal than the second.
// < checks to see if the first value is less than the second.
// <= checks to see if the first value is less than or equal to the second.

console.log(foo > bar); // 3 > 6 Output: false

console.log(foo >= three); // 3 >= 3 Output: true

console.log(foo < bar); // 3 < 6 Output: true

console.log(foo <= three); // 3 <= 3 Output: true</code-block>

  <p>We can use these <b>comparison operators</b> with our <b>conditionals</b>
  to dictate which path of a <b>conditional</b> our code uses. The most basic
  <b>conditional</b> in JavaScript is the <code>if</code> statement. If
  you've used other programming languages before you are likely familiar with
  this statement.</p>

  <code-block language="javascript">// If Statement

// Using a block like this defines an object.
let animal = {
  type: 'cat'
};

if (animal.type === 'cat') {
  console.log('meow');
}

// The output of this program would be 'meow'
</code-block>

  <p>A similar and related statement is the <code>if-else</code> statement. This
  statement allows you to branch your code into two separate paths, based on
  whether or not a conditional evaluates to <i>true</i> or <i>false</i></p>

  <code-block>//If Else Statement

let animal = {
  type: 'dog'
};

if (animal.type === 'cat') {
  console.log('meow');
} else {
  console.log('woof');
}

// The output of this program would be 'woof'
  </code-block>

  <p>In the example above, since the <code>animal.type</code> is a
  <code>'dog'</code>, the output is <i>woof</i>. It's often good to provide a
  more explicit definition for each expected case. Take a look at this
  example, which is the same as above with one change:</p>

  <code-block>//Changed If Else Statement

let animal = {
  type: 'pig' // Here's the change!
};

if (animal.type === 'cat') {
  console.log('meow');
} else {
  console.log('woof');
}

// The output of this program would be 'woof'
  </code-block>

  <p>Pigs don't woof! We can correct this by using an <code>if-else-if</code>
  statement to explicitly define an option. We can use the <code>else</code>
  block for our <b>default</b> case.</p>

  <code-block>//If Else If Statement

let animal = {
  type: 'pig' // Still a pig!
};

if (animal.type === 'cat') {
  console.log('meow');
} else if (animal.type === 'dog') {
  console.log('woof');
} else if (animal.type === 'pig') {
  console.log('oink');
} else {
  console.log('This animal is silent');
}

// The output of this program would be 'oink'
  </code-block>

  <p>Using a long <code>if-else-if</code> chain like the one above is often
  difficult to read and understand, so JavaScript gives us another statement to
  make this easier. This statement is called a <code>switch</code>.</p>

  <code-block>//Switch Statement

let animal = {
  type: 'pig' // Still a pig!
};

switch (animal.type) {
  case 'cat':
    console.log('meow');
    break;
  case 'dog':
    console.log('woof');
    break;
  case 'pig':
    console.log('oink');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('This animal is silent');
}

// The output of this program would be 'oink'
  </code-block>

  <p>An important part of the <code>switch</code> statement syntax is the use
  of the <code>break</code> statement. This is required, otherwise your code
  will <b>fall-through</b> to subsequent cases.</p>

  <code-block>//Switch Statement without Break

let animal = {
  type: 'cat' // Now a cat
};

switch (animal.type) {
  case 'cat':
    console.log('meow');
  case 'dog':
    console.log('woof');
  case 'pig':
    console.log('oink');
  default:
    console.log('This animal is silent');
}

// The output of this program would be:
//  meow
//  woof
//  oink
//  This animal is silent
  </code-block>

  <h1>Exercises</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>Create a conditional statement that evaluates <code>true</code> when
    a provided number is even. You can use the modulo operator, <code>%</code>
    to help with this. Modulo returns the <i>remainder</i> of a division
    operation.</li>
    <li>Using our created conditional statement, write a <code>if-else</code>
    control structure to print "Even" or "Odd" for a provided number.</li>
    <li>Convert the following <code>if-else-if</code> chain to a <code>switch</code>
    <code-block language="javascript">// Vehicle types
let vehicle = {
  type: 'car'
};

if (vehicle.type === 'car') {
  console.log('This is a fast car.');
} else if (vehicle.type === 'bike') {
  console.log('This is a nice bike!');
} else if (vehicle.type === 'boat') {
  console.log('This is a boat. Lets go fishing!');
} else {
  console.log('I don't know what kind of vehicle this is!');
}
</code-block>
    </li>
